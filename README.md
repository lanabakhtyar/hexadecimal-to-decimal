this is a very very simple python code that takes multiple lines of input from the user of it
and cleans the input aka gets rid of new lines and whitespaces and also prints the number 
of hexadecimal bytes (2 digits for 1 byte since its hexadecimal) , and then prints the output 
i wrote this code because i needed it for a ctf challenge...hope it helps anyone who needs it :)
